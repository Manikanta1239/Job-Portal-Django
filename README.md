## üîç Detailed Setup Guide

### Prerequisites Explained

1. **Python 3.8+**
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **pip (Python Package Manager)**
   - Should be included with Python installation
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

3. **Virtual Environment**
   - Keeps project dependencies isolated and prevents conflicts between projects
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate virtual environment:
     - **Windows:**
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **Linux/Mac:**
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Verify virtual environment is active:
     ```bash
     which python  # Should point to venv directory
     ```

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manikanta1239/Job-Portal-Django.git
cd Job-Portal-Django
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Configure Database
Edit `settings.py` to set up the database:

- **For SQLite (Default & Easy for Development)**
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

- **For PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)**
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

#### 4. Apply Migrations
Migrations are Django‚Äôs way of propagating changes you make to your models (such as adding a new field) into your database schema. This step ensures that the database structure aligns with your models.

- Create migration files based on model changes:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```
  This command generates migration files inside the `migrations/` directory of each app.

- Apply the migrations to the database:
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  This updates the actual database schema according to the latest migration files.

- If you encounter issues, try:
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
  ```
  This is useful when applying migrations to an existing database that already contains tables.

#### 5. Create Superuser (For Admin Panel Access)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Provide email, username, and password when prompted.

#### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
- Access the site at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- Admin panel: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`

## üîß Development Workflow

1. **Running Tests**
```bash
python manage.py test
```

2. **Managing Static Files**
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear
```

3. **Deploying to Production**
   - Use Gunicorn and Nginx for a production setup
   - Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
   - Enable HTTPS with an SSL certificate
